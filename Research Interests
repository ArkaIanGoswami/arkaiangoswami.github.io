I am interested in stochastic control, optimization, and machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in the development of efficient 
seqeuntial decision-making algorithms, particularly in stochastic and partially-observed systems. As such, most of my 
work involves Reinforcement Learning in some capacity. Recently, I have also been very interested in Safety and Interpretability towards Alignment. Particularly,
in the role that formal methods and mathematical logic have.

As an engineer-turned-to-be-scientist, I am very passionate about engineering education. Especially on the design of curricula and the depth and breadth at which
mathematics is taught. As part of my research, I have had to self-teach myself several topics in Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science. Rough notes for some topics
are available here. These are first drafts of my train-of-thought and may have some syntactic (or even conceptual) mistakes, although every effort has been made to mitigate the 
latter.
