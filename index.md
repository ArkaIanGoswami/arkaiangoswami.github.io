I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Centre for Intelligent Machines at McGill University.  
I am also affiliated to the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and GERAD.  


Before this, I received a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from The University of Manchester.  
I have previously worked at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and the NHS.
